/**
 * 
 * <h2>Bit Image Manipulation</h2>
 * <br>
 * The Bit module contains methods for reading and writing bitmap images.
 * <br>
 * It is worth mentioning that a Binary Image is internally saved as a Greyscale Image, and is
 * only converted to binary when reading from or writing to files. This way we can more easily
 * increase compatibility between modules and image access.
 * <br>
 * At the time of writing, the feature of reading and writing .pbm files is not yet implemented.
 * Instead, everything is treated as .pgm. Ideally, this would be implemented, but right now
 * it's just TODO:.
 * <br>
 * Some attempts were made to implement a way to internally save Bitmaps, namely, an integer 
 * array, in which each item would store 32 bits, resulting in an array of masks. This was not
 * the option chosen, yet, the methods were not deleted and there is available documentation for
 * each of them.
 * <br>
 * <b>In short</b>, binary image saving and loading were done with the Greyscale module. This module
 * would be useful in possible future versions.
